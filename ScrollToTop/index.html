                <p>Wow imagine play OW2 in 2025!, this game has been a downfall since it change to 5v5 and on top of that after Marvel Rivals came out this game basically die. The gameplay is not that bad there's also a lot of heroes in the games and all of them are very popular in certain kind of website but the queqe is very long to find rank match so 5/10.</p>

                <p>Let me tell you something about this game, AC Unity came out 11 years ago in 2014 but the graphic still better than most of the game nowadays how crazy is that? This game has amzing parkour systems / fighting systems and decent story. It also my childhood favourite game to watch! I considered this game to be the GREATEST AC GAME OF ALL TIME 11/10.</p>

                <p>I bought this game when it on 90% sale pretty solid price for such an amazing quality game. In this game you gotta play in Greek-Roman time where you got to explore all the ancient cities such as Sparta or Athens. In this game you bascially choose one of the 2 main characters Alexios and Kassadra whoever you chose the other one gonna be a villian by default. This game is pretty good but it completely change from the original Assasin game and turn it to rpg but it's still good tho 9/10.</p>

                <p>This game will forever in my childhood(?) memory because this is the game that made my YT channel go viral. This is Among Us the most popular game during the covid-19 incident back in 2020. It been played by almost every big youtuber/streamer in the whole planet. The game concept is pretty orginal so basically every game there's gonna be 1 aliens blend in with the crewmates you gotta find who tf that is. Pretty fun game to play with your friends 8/10.</p>

                <p>This game consumed 600 hours of my life. I first bought this game on my 10th birthday! It my favourite game of all time. The reason I played this game is because my favourite youtuber HRK play it with his friends and it seems really fun. So I bought it and started grinding until I reach ranked 1, gotta say this is the game I absolutely mastered it! 100/10 GOATED!</p>
